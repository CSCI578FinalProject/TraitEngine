     * The problem is that undoing all the config in start() and restoring
     * a 'fresh' state is impossible. After stop()/destroy()/init()/start()
     * we should have the same state as if a fresh start was done - i.e
     * read modified web.xml, etc. This can only be done by completely
     * removing the context object and remapping a new one, or by cleaning
     * up everything.
     *
