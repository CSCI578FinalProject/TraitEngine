    /**
     * Add a "call parameter" rule that sets a parameter from a
     * caller-provided object. This can be used to pass constants such as
     * strings to methods; it can also be used to pass mutable objects,
     * providing ways for objects to do things like "register" themselves
     * with some shared object.
     * <p>
     * Note that when attempting to locate a matching method to invoke,
     * the true type of the paramObj is used, so that despite the paramObj
     * being passed in here as type Object, the target method can declare
     * its parameters as being the true type of the object (or some ancestor
     * type, according to the usual type-conversion rules).
     *
     * @param paramIndex The zero-relative parameter number
     * @param paramObj Any arbitrary object to be passed to the target
     * method.
     * @see CallMethodRule
     *
