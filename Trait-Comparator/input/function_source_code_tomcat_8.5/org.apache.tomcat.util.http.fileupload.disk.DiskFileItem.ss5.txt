    /**
     * A convenience method to write an uploaded item to disk. The client code
     * is not concerned with whether or not the item is stored in memory, or on
     * disk in a temporary location. They just want to write the uploaded item
     * to a file.
     * <p>
     * This implementation first attempts to rename the uploaded item to the
     * specified destination file, if the item was originally written to disk.
     * Otherwise, the data will be copied to the specified file.
     * <p>
     * This method is only guaranteed to work <em>once</em>, the first time it
     * is invoked for a particular item. This is because, in the event that the
     * method renames a temporary file, that file will no longer be available
     * to copy or rename again at a later time.
     *
     * @param file The <code>File</code> into which the uploaded item should
     *             be stored.
     *
     * @throws Exception if an error occurs.
