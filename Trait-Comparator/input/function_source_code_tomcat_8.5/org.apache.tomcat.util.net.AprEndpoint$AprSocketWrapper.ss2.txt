    /**
     * Do a SSL renegotiation.
     * SSL supports per-directory re-configuration of SSL parameters.
     * This is implemented by performing an SSL renegotiation of the
     * re-configured parameters after the request is read, but before the
     * response is sent. In more detail: the renegotiation happens after the
     * request line and MIME headers were read, but _before_ the attached
     * request body is read. The reason simply is that in the HTTP protocol
     * usually there is no acknowledgment step between the headers and the
     * body (there is the 100-continue feature and the chunking facility
     * only), so Apache has no API hook for this step.
     *
